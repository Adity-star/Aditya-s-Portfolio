  "about": "Hi, I'm an AI Engineer and Freelancer Data Scientist passionate about building intelligent, agentic systems that solve real-world problems. Ever since I wrote my first Python script, I’ve been captivated by the power of data and intelligence to shape the world around us. What started as late-night curiosity quickly turned into an obsession with transforming raw data into actionable solutions.\n\nWith hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs), I specialize in designing AI-powered tools that drive innovation across industries. Currently, my focus is on cutting-edge projects in LangChain, LLM orchestration, and autonomous agents. From freelance initiatives to research-driven GenAI solutions, my work spans practical applications in finance, healthcare, and beyond.\n\nI don’t just build models; I architect intelligent systems that think, adapt, and solve real problems—whether it’s predicting traffic accident severity, summarizing long texts with transformers, or creating research agents that mimic human workflows. Each project is a new challenge, and I love solving them with precision and purpose.\n\nOutside the command line, I find joy in sketching ideas, mentoring early-stage AI enthusiasts, and exploring topics in AI ethics and tech philosophy. My goal is simple but bold: to build GenAI products that not only automate work but also elevate human potential. And I’m just getting started.",
